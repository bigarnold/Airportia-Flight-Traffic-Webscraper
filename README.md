# Airportia-Flight-Traffic-Webscraper
This webscraper presents a jupyter notebook ipywidget multi-dropdown menu from which you can select arrivals or departures for any airport in any country in the world and view a basic horizontal bar graph visualization representing the frequency of flights from top origins or to top destinations. Still a work in progress with some minor issues to iron out but it runs effectively for the most part.
